The purpose of business is a question that has different answers depending on who you ask and what perspective you're coming from.

**The traditional view** is that businesses exist to make profit for their owners or shareholders. This is often called the "[[Shareholder Primacy]]" model - the idea that management's primary duty is to maximize returns for investors.

**A broader [[Stakeholders|stakeholder]] view** argues that businesses serve multiple purposes: creating value for customers through products and services, providing livelihoods for employees, contributing to communities, and yes, generating returns for investors - but balancing all these interests rather than prioritizing just one.

**From society's perspective**, businesses solve problems and fulfill needs. They organize resources (people, capital, materials) efficiently to create things people want or need. In doing so, they drive innovation, create jobs, and generate economic growth. In Ed Zitron's article "The Era of the Business Idiot" he describes this as:

> ... "a company that makes something people like and people pay them for it and they make more money than they spend," ...

**Philosophically**, there's debate about whether profit is the purpose itself or merely a necessary condition for survival - like how eating isn't the purpose of your life, but you need to eat to pursue your actual purposes.

Some modern thinkers argue the best businesses have a clear _mission_ beyond profit - solving a specific problem or serving a particular need - and that profit follows naturally from doing that well. Others maintain that profit-seeking itself, when done ethically within market constraints, naturally leads to serving society by directing resources where they're most valued.
