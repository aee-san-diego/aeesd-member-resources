A conflict of interest occurs when a person or organization has competing interests or loyalties that could compromise their judgment, objectivity, or ability to act in the best interest of one party they're supposed to serve.

**The basic problem:** You're in a position where your personal interests (financial, professional, relational, etc.) might interfere with your duty to act impartially or in someone else's best interest.

**Common examples:**

- An engineer who owns stock in a supplier recommending that supplier's products to their employer
- A government official awarding contracts to their spouse's company
- A consultant working for two competing companies on similar projects
- An employee moonlighting for a competitor while still employed

**Why it matters:** Even if you believe you can remain objective, the mere appearance of a conflict can undermine trust and credibility. That's why the NSPE Code requires engineers to _disclose_ conflicts - the disclosure itself is often as important as avoiding the conflict.

> **Key distinction:** Having a conflict of interest isn't necessarily [[Ethics|unethical]] by itself - it's failing to disclose it or allowing it to improperly influence your decisions that creates the ethical violation. Many conflicts can be managed through transparency, recusal, or getting consent from all affected parties.

Two conflicts of interest, outlined in the [[Board for Professional Engineers, Land Surveyors, and Geologists|BPELSG]] [[Board for Professional Engineers, Land Surveyors, and Geologists#Code of Professional Conduct|Code of Professional Conduct]] are of particular relevance to [[Energy Engineering|energy engineers]]:
