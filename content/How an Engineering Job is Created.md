Before you ever see a job posting, a complex process has already unfolded behind the scenes. Understanding this process gives you valuable context for your job search, interview approach, and early performance on the job.

# The Business Case for Hiring
---
Engineering positions don't simply appear when someone quits or a team gets busy. Someone—usually an engineering manager or department head—had to build a business case and fight for approval to add headcount.

## The Trigger Event

Something prompted the need for a new position:

- **Revenue growth** - The company won new contracts or clients that require additional engineering capacity
- **New service offering** - The firm is expanding into a new market or service area (e.g., adding energy auditing to a mechanical design firm)
- **Backlog buildup** - Existing staff can't keep up with current workload, and projects are being delayed or turned away
- **Strategic initiative** - Leadership has committed to a new direction that requires engineering support (e.g., corporate sustainability goals requiring energy management)
- **Replacement need** - Someone left, but the business case still had to be made to backfill rather than redistribute the work
- **Regulatory requirement** - New codes or regulations require engineering oversight the company didn't previously need

## Building the Financial Justification

The engineering manager had to demonstrate that hiring you will generate value exceeding your cost:

**For service firms:**

- Projected billable hours and revenue generation
- Expected utilization rate (typically 70-85% billable)
- Client demand that can't be met with current staff
- Potential new clients attracted by expanded capacity or expertise

**For product companies:**

- Development timelines that require additional engineering resources
- Market opportunities that will be missed without faster product development
- Competitive pressures requiring innovation or cost reduction
- Revenue projections for products requiring engineering support

**For operations:**

- Cost savings from energy efficiency, process optimization, or maintenance improvements
- Risk reduction from improved compliance or system reliability
- Capital projects requiring engineering oversight
- Operational problems that need engineering solutions

The manager likely prepared spreadsheets showing that the new position will generate $X in additional revenue or save $Y in costs, exceeding the all-in cost of employing you (salary + benefits + overhead, typically 1.5-2x your salary).

# The Approval Process
---

Getting approval to hire isn't automatic:
## Internal Competition

The engineering manager competed with other departments for limited headcount:

- Finance wanted another accountant
- Sales wanted another business development person
- Operations wanted another technician

The engineering manager had to convince leadership that an engineer provides better ROI than these alternatives.

## Budget Constraints

Someone approved a salary range for the position based on:

- What the company can afford given financial projections
- Market rates for similar positions (often researched through salary surveys)
- Internal equity with existing staff
- How badly they need to fill the role

**Important:** By the time you interview, the salary range is often locked in. The hiring manager may have limited flexibility, especially at larger companies with formal compensation structures.

## Political Capital

The engineering manager spent political capital to get this position approved. They made promises about what this hire will accomplish. Your future performance will reflect on their judgment and credibility within the organization.

# The Job Description is Created
---

Once approved, someone wrote the job description—and it reveals a lot:

## What They Actually Need vs. What They Listed

- **The wishlist** - HR and the hiring manager listed every skill that would be nice to have
- **The reality** - They'll settle for someone who can do the core job and learn the rest
- **The dealbreakers** - A few requirements are actually mandatory (often regulatory or client-driven)

**Key insight:** Job descriptions are aspirational. If you meet 70% of the requirements and can demonstrate learning ability, you're probably qualified.

## The Timeline Pressure

- **Immediate need** - A critical project is waiting, or they're losing revenue without this position filled
- **Planned growth** - They're building for future capacity and can afford to be selective
- **Backfill** - Someone left and there's urgent work piling up

The timeline affects their flexibility on requirements and salary.

# What This Means for Your Job Search

## Understanding the Context Helps You Interview Better

When you interview, the hiring manager is evaluating:

- **Can you do the work?** (Technical competence)
- **Will you generate the projected value?** (Justifying their business case)
- **Will you make me look good?** (Reflecting well on their judgment)
- **Will you fit the team?** (Cultural and interpersonal dynamics)

Your technical skills matter, but so does demonstrating that you understand the business need and can help the hiring manager succeed.

## You Can Ask Strategic Questions

Understanding the backstory lets you ask insightful questions:

- "What prompted the decision to create this position?" (Reveals the real need)
- "What would success look like in the first 6-12 months?" (Shows what they promised leadership)
- "What challenges is the team currently facing?" (Uncovers what problem you're solving)

These questions demonstrate business maturity and help you assess if the role is right for you.

## You Can Evaluate the Opportunity More Clearly

Red flags to watch for:

- Vague answers about why the position exists (they may not have a clear need)
- Unrealistic expectations given the salary range (overoptimistic projections)
- High turnover in similar roles (the business case may be flawed)
- Constantly changing requirements (they don't actually know what they need)

## You Can Negotiate More Effectively

Knowing the position was hard-fought helps you understand:

- Where there might be [[Compensation and Negotiation|flexibility in the offer]]
- What matters most to the hiring manager (and what you can emphasize)
- Why they might be rigid on certain terms (budget constraints from the approval process)

## What This Means for Your First Year

### You're Validating the Hiring Manager's Decision

Your early performance isn't just about doing good work—it's about proving the hiring manager was right to fight for this position. They need to show leadership that:

- The revenue/savings projections were accurate
- You're contributing to the goals that justified the hire
- The investment in you is paying off

This is why your first year is so critical. You're not just learning the job; you're validating a business case.

### Understanding Expectations

The business case that created your job shapes what's expected:

- Hired for a new contract? Meeting that client's needs is priority one.
- Hired to reduce backlog? Productivity and efficiency matter most.
- Hired for strategic initiative? Demonstrating progress toward that goal is key.
- Hired for cost savings? Showing measurable impact on operating costs proves your worth.

# Conclusion

Your job didn't magically appear—it was created through a deliberate business process involving financial projections, internal approvals, and someone's professional credibility. Understanding this context makes you a more informed candidate during the job search and a more effective employee once hired. The hiring manager needs you to succeed almost as much as you need the job to work out, because your performance validates their judgment and business case.

Remember this throughout your job search and early tenure: you're not just filling a position, you're helping someone prove they made a good business decision.
