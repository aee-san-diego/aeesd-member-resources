Company culture is sometimes considered a fluffy concept. But, it is real.

Company culture is the actual lived experience of working somewhere - the unwritten rules, the real incentives, what behavior gets rewarded or punished, how decisions actually get made, and what people genuinely believe matters versus what's on a poster in the break room.

It's not the mission statement or the values list on the website. It's what happens when those stated values conflict with making deadline or hitting a number. It's whether people feel safe raising problems, whether leadership admits mistakes, whether "work-life balance" means you're actually expected to answer emails at 9 PM or not.

You can usually identify a company's real culture by watching what happens when things go wrong, who gets promoted, what kinds of meetings waste everyone's time, and what topics people avoid discussing openly.

The gap between stated culture ("we value innovation and taking risks!") and actual culture ("don't ever bring me a problem without a solution, and make sure it succeeds") is often where the dysfunction lives.
