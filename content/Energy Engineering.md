There is no single, universally cited "formal definition" of an energy engineer published by the [[Association of Energy Engineers]], although the organization has been instrumental in defining the profession through its comprehensive approach to professional standards, certification programs, and educational initiatives.

Some indication of the challenge of defining energy engineering is that even Wikipedia categorizes energy engineering in two branches of engineering:

1. As a sub-branch of mechanical engineering
2. As a sub-branch in the interdisciplinary category

By reformulating some of what is written in Wikipedia, we might define energy engineering more in terms of what an energy engineer does versus what an energy engineer is:

- Energy engineers work in various roles (research, design, application, policy) to identify and recommend/specify technologies that represent the most efficient and sustainable ways to meet the world's demand for energy.
- Energy engineering is one of the most recent engineering disciplines to emerge and is a highly [[Energy Engineering is Highly Multidisciplinary|multidisciplinary field]].
- Energy engineering plays a critical role in addressing global challenges like [[Climate Change]], reducing [[Greenhouse Gas Emissions]], and the transition from fossil fuels to renewable energy sources.

# History of Energy Engineering
---
## The Energy Crisis Era (1970s)

- The **oil crisis of 1973** served as a pivotal catalyst, highlighting the critical need for energy efficiency and energy independence
- In **1977**, **Albert Thumann** founded the **Association of Energy Engineers (AEE)** in Atlanta, Georgia - a watershed moment for the profession.

In 1977, when Albert Thumann founded AEE, there were no dedicated "energy engineering" degree programs. Here's what actually existed:

**Core Engineering Disciplines:**

1. **Mechanical Engineering** - The most common path, covering thermodynamics, heat transfer, HVAC systems, and energy conversion
2. **Electrical Engineering** - Especially power engineering concentrations focusing on generation, transmission, and distribution
3. **Industrial Engineering** - Focusing on plant operations, facilities management, and process optimization
4. **Chemical Engineering** - Covering combustion processes, fuel processing, and energy-related chemical reactions
5. **Civil Engineering** - Including environmental and building systems aspects

**Some emerging specializations by the 1970s:**

- **Environmental Engineering** (established at some schools like Cal Poly by 1971)
- **Power Engineering** (as a concentration within Electrical Engineering)
- Interdisciplinary programs like "Engineering Science" or "Environmental Sciences Engineering" (established around 1970-71 at some universities)

People who became energy engineers in the late 1970s and early 1980s would have:

- **Held degrees in one of the traditional engineering fields** (most commonly Mechanical, Electrical, or Industrial Engineering)
- **Gained practical experience** in industrial plants, utilities, or facilities management
- **Self-taught or received on-the-job training** in energy conservation and management
- **Attended continuing education seminars** like the one Thumann started at NYU in 1976 - described as "the first industrial energy conservation seminar in the nation"

This is exactly why the founding of AEE in 1977 was so significant - it helped **define and professionalize** what energy engineers and energy managers actually did, at a time when no formal academic programs existed to train them.
