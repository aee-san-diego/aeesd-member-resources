A single definition for energy engineering is challenging because [[Energy Engineering is Highly Multidisciplinary]]

## The Energy Crisis Era (1970s)

- The **oil crisis of 1973** served as a pivotal catalyst, highlighting the critical need for energy efficiency and energy independence
- In **1977**, **Albert Thumann** founded the **Association of Energy Engineers (AEE)** in Atlanta, Georgia - a watershed moment for the profession.

In 1977, when Albert Thumann founded AEE, there were no dedicated "energy engineering" degree programs. Here's what actually existed:

**Core Engineering Disciplines:**

1. **Mechanical Engineering** - The most common path, covering thermodynamics, heat transfer, HVAC systems, and energy conversion
2. **Electrical Engineering** - Especially power engineering concentrations focusing on generation, transmission, and distribution
3. **Industrial Engineering** - Focusing on plant operations, facilities management, and process optimization
4. **Chemical Engineering** - Covering combustion processes, fuel processing, and energy-related chemical reactions
5. **Civil Engineering** - Including environmental and building systems aspects

**Some emerging specializations by the 1970s:**

- **Environmental Engineering** (established at some schools like Cal Poly by 1971)
- **Power Engineering** (as a concentration within Electrical Engineering)
- Interdisciplinary programs like "Engineering Science" or "Environmental Sciences Engineering" (established around 1970-71 at some universities)

People who became energy engineers in the late 1970s and early 1980s would have:

- **Held degrees in one of the traditional engineering fields** (most commonly Mechanical, Electrical, or Industrial Engineering)
- **Gained practical experience** in industrial plants, utilities, or facilities management
- **Self-taught or received on-the-job training** in energy conservation and management
- **Attended continuing education seminars** like the one Thumann started at NYU in 1976 - described as "the first industrial energy conservation seminar in the nation"

This is exactly why the founding of AEE in 1977 was so significant - it helped **define and professionalize** what energy engineers and energy managers actually did, at a time when no formal academic programs existed to train them.
