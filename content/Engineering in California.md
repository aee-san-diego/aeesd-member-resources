> In California, the title "engineer" and the practice of engineering are regulated by the Board for Professional Engineers, Land Surveyors, and Geologists (BPELSG). This board operates under the California Department of Consumer Affairs and is responsible for licensing and regulating the engineering profession to protect public health, safety, and welfare.

## Who Can Call Themselves an "Engineer" in California?

California law is strict about who can use the title "engineer." Under Business and Professions Code Section 6732, it is illegal to practice engineering or use the title "engineer" (or any variation like "professional engineer" or "consulting engineer") without proper licensure, with specific exemptions.

**Licensed Professional Engineers (PE)** Only individuals who have:

- Earned an engineering degree from an ABET-accredited program (or equivalent)
- Passed the Fundamentals of Engineering (FE) exam
- Gained at least four years of qualifying engineering experience
- Passed the Principles and Practice of Engineering (PE) exam in their discipline
- Been granted a license by the BPELSG

## Recognized Engineering Disciplines

The BPELSG licenses Professional Engineers in specific disciplines:

- **Civil Engineering**
- **Mechanical Engineering**
- **Electrical Engineering**
- **Chemical Engineering**
- **Industrial Engineering**
- **Agricultural Engineering**
- **Control Systems Engineering**
- **Fire Protection Engineering**
- **Metallurgical Engineering**
- **Nuclear Engineering**
- **Petroleum Engineering**
- **Traffic Engineering**

> [!NOTE]
> Note what's **missing from this list: Energy Engineering**. There is no PE license specifically for "Energy Engineering" in California.

## The Energy Engineering Dilemma

This creates an interesting situation for energy engineers in California:

### Option 1: Practice Under an Existing License

Most energy engineers obtain their PE license in one of the recognized disciplines that closely aligns with their work:

- **Mechanical PE** - Most common for energy engineers focusing on HVAC, building systems, thermal systems, or industrial process efficiency
- **Electrical PE** - Common for those focusing on power systems, lighting, controls, or electrical efficiency
- **Industrial PE** - Appropriate for those focusing on facilities management and process optimization

### Option 2: Work Under Exemptions

California law provides exemptions that allow unlicensed individuals to perform engineering work in certain contexts:

**The Industrial Exemption** (Business and Professions Code Section 6747) Allows unlicensed engineers to work for private corporations on equipment, machinery, or processes for that company's internal use—not for public sale or construction projects. Many energy engineers working in corporate energy management or for manufacturers operate under this exemption.

**Employee Exemption** Engineers working as employees of licensed engineers or engineering firms under the responsible charge of a PE may perform engineering work without their own license, though they cannot independently offer engineering services to the public.

### Option 3: Work in Non-Licensed Capacity

Some energy work doesn't constitute "engineering" under California law:

- Energy audits and assessments that don't involve design
- Energy management consulting and strategy
- Building commissioning and verification (though this gets complicated)
- Training and education
- Research and development in non-public-facing contexts

However, the line can be blurry, and energy professionals must be careful about what they claim to do and how they represent themselves.

## What Constitutes "Engineering Practice"?

California defines the practice of engineering broadly. Under Business and Professions Code Section 6731, it includes:

- Professional services requiring engineering education, training, and experience
- Application of engineering principles and data
- Services related to structures, machines, equipment, processes, or projects

**This means that energy engineers who:**

- Design or specify building systems
- Stamp drawings or calculations
- Offer services to the public as an "engineer"
- Perform work that affects public safety or welfare

**...typically need to be licensed or work under a licensed PE.**

## Implications for Energy Engineers

### You May Need to Get Licensed

If your work involves:

- Designing HVAC or electrical systems for buildings
- Stamping engineering calculations or drawings
- Offering engineering services to the public
- Working on projects requiring building permits

You'll likely need a PE license in an appropriate discipline.

### Your Job Title Matters

California takes the use of "engineer" in job titles seriously. While the enforcement is not always aggressive, technically:

- **Acceptable**: "Energy Analyst," "Energy Consultant," "Energy Manager," "Energy Specialist"
- **Risky without license**: "Energy Engineer" (when offering services to the public or implying you're a licensed professional)

Many energy professionals use "Certified Energy Manager" (CEM) or similar certifications to establish credibility without claiming to be licensed engineers.

### Your Employer Structure Matters

- Working for a **utility company** in energy efficiency programs? Likely okay under employee exemption.
- Working for a **large corporation** managing internal facilities? Likely covered by industrial exemption.
- Working for a **consulting firm** offering engineering services to clients? You or your responsible supervisor needs a PE.
- **Self-employed** offering energy engineering services? You almost certainly need a PE.

## Professional Certifications vs. Licensure

Energy engineers often hold professional certifications like:

- **Certified Energy Manager (CEM)** - Association of Energy Engineers
- **Certified Energy Auditor (CEA)** - Association of Energy Engineers
- **Certified Measurement & Verification Professional (CMVP)** - Association of Energy Engineers
- **LEED AP** - U.S. Green Building Council
- **Building Performance Institute (BPI)** certifications

**These certifications are NOT equivalent to PE licensure** and don't authorize you to practice engineering under California law. However, they demonstrate professional competency and may be required or preferred by employers and clients.

## Practical Guidance for Energy Engineers in California

### If You're Starting Your Career:

1. Get your engineering degree from an ABET-accredited program
2. Take the FE exam while still in school or shortly after graduation
3. Gain qualifying experience under a licensed PE when possible
4. Consider which PE discipline aligns best with your career goals
5. Take the PE exam once you have sufficient experience

### If You're Already Practicing:

1. Evaluate whether your work constitutes engineering practice under California law
2. Consider whether you need PE licensure based on your specific responsibilities
3. If you're not licensed, ensure you're working under appropriate exemptions
4. Be careful about how you represent yourself and your services
5. Consider pursuing relevant professional certifications (CEM, CEA, etc.)

### If You're Offering Services to the Public:

You almost certainly need to be licensed or work under a licensed PE. Consult with the BPELSG or an attorney if you're uncertain about your specific situation.

## Why This Matters

California's engineering licensure laws exist to protect public safety. Buildings, power systems, and industrial facilities can pose significant risks if designed improperly. The PE license ensures that engineers have met minimum standards of education, experience, and competency.

For energy engineers, navigating these requirements means:

- Understanding the scope of what you can legally do without licensure
- Pursuing appropriate licensure if your work requires it
- Using accurate job titles and representations
- Maintaining professional standards even when working under exemptions
