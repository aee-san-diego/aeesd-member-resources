### **Definitions & San Diego Specifics**

*   **Occupied Hours:** The typical hours customers or employees are physically present.
*   **HVAC System Runtime (Fan Hours):** This represents the number of hours the system fans are moving air. In San Diego's mild Climate Zone 7, the =="Cooling Load Hours" (when the compressor is actually freezing air) are much lower than the Fan Hours==—typically only 800–1,200 hours/year for offices—because the fans often run in "Economizer Mode," using cool outside air to condition the building without mechanical cooling.
*   Lighting Burn Hours: This accounts for "burn time" including before/after hours cleaning, security patrols, and restocking. California's energy code (Title 24) is strict; most of these buildings will have occupancy sensors that auto-off lights, keeping these numbers tighter to occupied hours than in other states.

- **Note on Climate Zone:** San Diego County consists largely of **California Climate Zone 7** (Coastal/Central San Diego) and **Climate Zone 10** (Inland East County). The values below are weighted toward **Zone 7 (Coastal)**, which represents the majority of the commercial building stock. For Inland (Zone 10) locations, cooling hours will be approximately 20-30% higher.
