In the professional world, "relationship" is a broad term that often conflates two different types of connections.

1. The Transactional Relationship (The Contact)
	- This is based on **utility**. These connections exist because of a current project, a contract, or a shared immediate goal. They are transactional and often fleeting.
	- The definition: "We know each other because we need each other right now."
	- The limit: Once the utility is gone (the project ends), the connection usually fades.

2. The Foundational Relationship (The Ally)
	- This is based on [[Trust|trust capital]]. These connections are forged through shared adversity, reliability over time, and mutual respect.
	- The definition: "We help each other because we respect each other."
	- The value: These relationships are resilient. They survive job changes, failed projects, and economic downturns.

You can start a relationship transactionally, but you must maintain it intentionally to make it foundational. A contact is just data in your phone; a relationship is the ability to ask for help—or give it—without keeping score.
