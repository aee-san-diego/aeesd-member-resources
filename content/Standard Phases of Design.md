The AEC industry breaks design work into distinct phases, each with specific goals, deliverables, and levels of detail. Understanding these phases helps energy engineers know what to expect and what to ask for at each stage of a project.

## **Pre-Design / Programming** 

This is the phase before formal design begins. The project team identifies needs, establishes goals, develops preliminary budgets, and defines the scope. Energy efficiency goals and utility program requirements should be established here.

## **Schematic Design (SD)** 

The design team develops basic concepts and overall project approach. Drawings show general layouts, major systems, and overall building form. Details are minimal - this is about big-picture decisions. The completion of the SD phase is usually considered around 25%-30% design completion. Cost estimates at this phase are rough.

## **Design Development (DD)** 

The design becomes more specific. Systems are sized, materials are selected, and major components are defined. Drawings show more detail but aren't yet at the level needed for construction. The completion of the DD phase is usually considered around 50%-60% design completion. Cost estimates become more refined.

## **Construction Documents (CD)** 

This is the final design phase where detailed drawings and specifications are prepared for bidding and construction (in a traditional design-bid-build [[Delivery Methods|delivery method]]). Everything needed to build the project should be documented. The design is considered 100% complete. Costs should be well-defined at this point.

## **Bidding / Procurement** 

Not always considered a distinct design phase, but contractors review the construction documents and submit bids. The design team may answer questions and issue clarifications.

> [!warning]
> **For Energy Engineers:** When you ask for a "design" or "cost estimate," which phase are you really asking about? A schematic-level estimate will be very different from a construction document-level estimate. Similarly, trying to finalize energy savings calculations during schematic design often means making assumptions that will change as the design develops.

# UCSD Definitions

From: https://plandesignbuild.ucsd.edu/design/descriptions.html
## Pre-Design

A project charter is developed which defines the preliminary and conceptual scope, budget and schedule of the project. The charter indicates the needs and functions of the user and the potential square footage. Following selection of an Executive Design Professional, potential pre-design includes preparation of a Detailed Project Program.

## Schematic Design

Schematic design is the first phase of basic services for project design. At this stage in a project, the design professional describes the project three-dimensionally. A range of alternative design concepts are explored to define the character of the completed project and an optimum realization of the detailed project program.

## Design Development

During the design development phase, the project design is further refined. Plan arrangements, specific space accommodations, equipment and furnishings, building design, materials and colors, and complete definitions of all systems serving the project are developed. All design decisions are completed during this phase in order to prepare the subsequent construction documents.

## Construction Documents

The construction document phase consists of preparation of drawings and specifications establishing the requirements for construction of the project. The construction documents describe the quality, configuration, size, and relationship of all components to be incorporated into the project. Construction documents must be consistent with the detailed project program, the construction budget and the project schedule. The construction documents serve as a basis for obtaining bids from contractors and are used by contractors to obtain price quotes from subcontractors.
