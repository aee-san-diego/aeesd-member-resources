The AEC industry breaks design work into distinct phases, each with specific goals, deliverables, and levels of detail. Understanding these phases helps energy engineers know what to expect and what to ask for at each stage of a project.

**Pre-Design / Programming** This is the phase before formal design begins. The project team identifies needs, establishes goals, develops preliminary budgets, and defines the scope. Energy efficiency goals and utility program requirements should be established here.

**Schematic Design (SD)** The design team develops basic concepts and overall project approach. Drawings show general layouts, major systems, and overall building form. Details are minimal - this is about big-picture decisions. Cost estimates at this phase are rough, often ±20-30%.

**Design Development (DD)** The design becomes more specific. Systems are sized, materials are selected, and major components are defined. Drawings show more detail but aren't yet at the level needed for construction. Cost estimates become more refined, typically ±10-15%.

**Construction Documents (CD)** This is the final design phase where detailed drawings and specifications are prepared for bidding and construction. Everything needed to build the project should be documented. Costs should be well-defined at this point, usually ±5-10%.

**Bidding / Procurement** Not always considered a distinct design phase, but contractors review the construction documents and submit bids. The design team may answer questions and issue clarifications.

**For Energy Engineers:** When you ask for a "design" or "cost estimate," which phase are you really asking about? A schematic-level estimate will be very different from a construction document-level estimate. Similarly, trying to finalize energy savings calculations during schematic design often means making assumptions that will change as the design develops.
