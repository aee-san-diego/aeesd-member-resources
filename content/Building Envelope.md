The term "glazing" refers specifically to the process of installing glass in windows, doors, or other openings. So "glazing contractors" are professionals who specialize in working with glass itself - cutting, fitting, and installing it into frames.

The word "glazing" comes from the Middle English "glasen," meaning to fit with glass. Historically, before modern window manufacturing, installing glass panes was a specialized trade distinct from carpentry or general construction.

Today, while many window contractors do handle complete window installation (frame and all), the term "glazing contractor" emphasizes the glass work aspect. You'll often see this term used for:

- Commercial buildings where large glass panels are installed
- Repair work focused on replacing broken panes
- Specialty glass work like storefronts, curtain walls, or custom installations
- Projects involving just the glass component rather than entire window units

So essentially, all glaziers work with windows, but not all window work is strictly "glazing" - though the terms often overlap in everyday usage.
