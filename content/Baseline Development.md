Baseline development is the critical process of developing not merely a list of equipment, but a model of how that equipment behaves over time. To construct an accurate baseline, the energy engineer must bridge the gap between the static physical assets and the dynamic energy consumption recorded on the meter.

This process relies on two distinct but complementary investigative streams:

1. The Physical Evaluation ("What is There"). This is typically an in-person site evaluation / [[Energy Audit]]. This is the qualitative inventory of the facility. The analyst documents the mechanical and electrical infrastructure—chiller efficiencies, lighting types, and boiler capacities. Crucially, this phase also captures the operational reality: Are the lights actually turning off at 6:00 PM as scheduled? are dampers stuck open? Is the building automation system calibrated? This step establishes the theoretical potential of the building’s systems.

2. The Quantitative Reconciliation ("How it Performs"). Once the physical systems are understood, mathematical models are developed to estimate the energy usage and demand of the physical systems. The [[San Diego Utility Rates|utility rates]] are applied to quantify the financial performance. The results are are cross-referenced against "the reality" of the utility bills. By examining historical consumption patterns, peak demand intervals, and weather-dependency, the energy engineer identifies the building’s actual energy signature.

The heart of baseline development is the [[Model Calibration|calibration]] of these two workstreams. Often, the physical inspection and the utility bills do not initially agree—a building may theoretically be efficient but is consuming energy like an inefficient one due to hidden operational faults. The analyst must refine their inputs and operational assumptions until the calculated energy use matches the historical utility bills.

When this calibration is complete (and deciding [[Engineering Judgment and Acceptable Accuracy|when calibration is good enough]] is a separate discussion of its own), the result is a validated Base Case: a robust, defensible model that accurately reflects not just what equipment the building contains, but a solid understanding of how that equipment is being used to incur the operating costs.
