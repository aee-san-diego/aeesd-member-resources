# 1. Update Design Data

As recently at 2025, the [[Title 24]] Reference Appendices provide [[HVAC Outdoor Design Conditions|design data]] for California which is based on:

```
"ASHRAE Climatic Data for Region X, Arizona, California, Hawaii and Nevada," Publication SPCDX, 1982 and “Supplement,” 1994
```

This is interesting because the data is, at minimum, over 30 years old and at this point, in relation to [[Climate Change]], its validity is debatable.
