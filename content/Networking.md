# Two Types of Networking

Many engineers would rather build an energy model than walk into a "networking mixer" with a stack of business cards. Why? Maybe because walking around a room trying to force a connection with strangers can be awkward. But, if you think about it, there are actually two very different types of networking. Understanding the difference is the key to actually enjoying your career development.
## Type 1: Transactional (Networking is something you DO)

This is the "Salesy" approach. It is strategic, linear, and goal-oriented.

- **The Mindset:** "I need a job/client/lead. Who in this room can give it to me?"
- **The Mechanism:** You do networking. You target specific people, you deliver an elevator pitch, and you extract a contact.
- **The Vibe:** It feels like hunting.
- **The Pro:** It is efficient when you have an urgent need.
- **The Con:** It is exhausting and often sets off people’s "sales radar," making authentic connection impossible.
## Type 2: Relational (Networking is something that HAPPENS)

This is the "Genuine" approach. It is organic, non-linear, and curiosity-oriented.

- **The Mindset:** "I’m interested in X so I'll go to that session at the conference. That person in the conference session asked a really interesting question to the presenter - I should talk to them!"
- **The Mechanism:** Networking happens as a byproduct of shared enthusiasm. You geek out over a technical problem, you commiserate over a bad code cycle, or you debate equipment choices.
- **The Vibe:** It feels like exploring.
- **The Pro:** It builds deep, high-trust relationships that last decades.
- **The Con:** It is slow. You cannot force a timeline on chemistry.
## The Hybrid Reality

Here is the nuance. We are complex humans living in a professional world. We can't always purely "hang out" (Mode 2) because we have work to do. But we cannot purely "hunt" (Mode 1) because nobody wants to talk to a robot (or be "hunted" and considered "a target").

> - **The "Happen" part:** Once you are in the room, you turn off the "sales" switch and turn on the "curiosity" switch. You stop looking for prospects and start looking for interesting conversations.

When you focus on the topic rather than the transaction, the networking takes care of itself. The business cards will be exchanged not because you forced it, but because you both want to continue the conversation.

**The Takeaway:** Don’t go to events "to network." Go to events to learn and to meet people who care about what you care about. If you do that, the network of [[Relationships|relationships]] will build itself around you.
