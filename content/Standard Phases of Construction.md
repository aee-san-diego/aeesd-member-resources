Once design is complete, the AEC industry follows a structured approach to actually building the project. Energy engineers often interact with projects during construction but may not understand the distinct phases involved.

**For Energy Engineers:** When you're asking about project status or trying to schedule a site visit, understanding these phases helps you know what's actually happening on site and what information is available. Asking for performance data during early construction won't work - the equipment isn't installed yet. Asking for submittals during closeout is too late - those were reviewed months ago.
# **Pre-Construction** 

After a contractor is selected but before physical construction begins, the team finalizes logistics: permits, submittals, scheduling, mobilization, and site preparation. This is when the contractor develops the detailed construction schedule and confirms how the project will actually be built.

## **Submittals and Procurement** 

The contractor submits product data, shop drawings, and samples for review by the design team. Equipment and materials are ordered. This phase determines what specific products will actually be installed - not just generic specifications but actual manufacturers and model numbers. For energy projects, this is critical for confirming performance specifications.

# **Construction** 
Physical building happens. The contractor manages trades, coordinates installations, and addresses field conditions. Site visits and inspections occur. Changes and clarifications are common as the design meets reality.

## **Substantial Completion** 
The project is essentially complete and ready for occupancy, though minor punch list items may remain. Systems should be functional and the owner can begin using the space.

## **Commissioning and Start-up** 
Systems are tested, adjusted, and verified to operate as designed. Training is provided to operators. For energy projects, this is when you confirm that efficiency measures are actually functioning properly.

## **Closeout** 
Final documentation is submitted: as-built drawings, operation and maintenance manuals, warranties, and final accounting. Punch list items are completed.

# **Measurement and Verification (M&V)** 
Not standard in most typical AEC projects but common in energy projects. Post-occupancy monitoring confirms that energy savings are being achieved. This may extend months or years after construction completion.
