# Energy Analysis

An energy savings analysis is a comparative financial and physical investigation. The goal is to transform the complex thermodynamics of a building into actionable information for making business decisions. The analysis bridges the gap between how a facility operates today and how it could perform tomorrow, providing the data necessary to justify capital investment. An energy savings analysis removes the guesswork from sustainability. It empowers [[Stakeholders|stakeholders]] to make evidence-based decisions that optimize operational efficiency, reduce carbon footprints, and maximize financial returns.

The process is fundamentally an exercise in isolation and comparison, structured in three distinct phases:

1. Establishing the [[Baseline Development|Baseline]].  Before savings can be claimed, the status quo must be rigorously defined. This involves quantifying the facility’s current energy profile—calibrating the physics of the building envelope, equipment schedules, and occupant behavior against historical utility bills. This baseline serves as the "control group" of the experiment, ensuring that the starting point is grounded in reality rather than theoretical assumptions.
2. Modeling the Alternatives. Once the baseline is secured, the analysis introduces specific Energy Conservation Measures (ECMs)—interventions ranging from simple LED retrofits to complex central plant optimizations. By simulating these alternatives under identical weather and operational conditions, the analysis isolates the performance of the new technology.
3. Quantifying the Difference. The true output of the analysis is the delta—the difference between the Baseline and the Proposed case. This technical reduction in kilowatt-hours or therms is monetized using [[San Diego Utility Rates|utility rate]] structures to project annual cost avoidance. Finally, this revenue stream is weighed against the construction cost to calculate financial metrics such as Return on Investment (ROI), Net Present Value (NPV), Simple Payback, and [[Savings to Investment Ratio|SIR]].
