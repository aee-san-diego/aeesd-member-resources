> As of January 1, 2026, the active version of Title 24 is the 2025 edition

> [!tip]
> We urge every energy engineer in San Diego to invest the time to thoroughly read and internalize Title 24, rather than simply treating it as a reference document. Because the code only updates every three years, this deep dive yields a high return on investment, providing foundational knowledge that will distinguish your expertise for the duration of your career.

> [!NOTE]
> **When you don't need to follow Title 24:**
> 
> Title 24 is primarily a construction and permitting standard, triggered by new builds, additions, alterations (retrofits), and repairs; it does not dictate the methodology for all energy analysis. 
> 
> For work that does not require a construction permit, such as the following, you are not bound by the code’s prescriptive rules or standardized compliance schedules:
> 
> - Benchmarking
> - Financial feasibility analysis
> - Retro-commissioning savings calculations
> - Measurement & Verification (M&V)
> 
>  In these scenarios, you have the professional freedom to model systems based on actual physics, historical utility data, and real-world operating conditions to generate accurate ROI projections for business decisions. However, a strong command of Title 24 remains essential even here, as it defines the 'standard practice' baseline against which high-performance options should be compared.
