# Education

[[Energy Engineering|Energy engineering]] is a highly [[Energy Engineering is Highly Multidisciplinary|multi-disciplinary]] field that requires knowledge of many subjects. 

While AEE doesn't strictly define educational requirements for energy engineers, the membership categories suggest that practitioners typically hold degrees in engineering (although AEE individual members can have an engineering, architectural, business, or law degree) and, in practice, most energy engineers come from engineering backgrounds.

If you plan to practice engineering in California and use the title "engineer" professionally, you'll need a degree from an ABET-accredited program and licensure as a Professional Engineer in one of the state's [[Engineering in California|recognized disciplines]]. For aspiring energy engineers, the most relevant programs are:

- **Mechanical Engineering** - Covers HVAC, thermodynamics, and building systems
- **Electrical Engineering** - Focuses on power systems, lighting, and controls
- **Industrial Engineering** - Emphasizes facilities management and process optimization
- **Control Systems Engineering** - Addresses automation and system integration

Most energy engineers pursue one of these four disciplines, as they align most closely with the multidisciplinary nature of energy work.

# Registration and Certification

## Professional Engineer (PE) Licensure

After completing an ABET-accredited engineering degree, the path to becoming a licensed Professional Engineer in California involves several steps:

1. **Pass the Fundamentals of Engineering (FE) exam** - Typically taken during your final year of college or shortly after graduation. Passing this exam grants you the title "Engineer in Training" (EIT) or "Engineering Intern."
2. **Gain qualifying work experience** - Accumulate at least four years of progressive engineering experience under the supervision of a licensed PE. This experience must demonstrate increasing responsibility and complexity.
3. **Pass the Principles and Practice of Engineering (PE) exam** - A discipline-specific exam (Mechanical, Electrical, Industrial, etc.) that tests your competency to practice independently.
4. **Apply for licensure** - Submit your application, experience records, and references to the [[Engineering in California|California Board for Professional Engineers, Land Surveyors, and Geologists (BPELSG)]].

Not all energy engineers need PE licensure—it depends on the type of work you do and who you work for. However, if you plan to offer engineering services to the public, stamp drawings, or work independently as a consultant, licensure is typically required.
## AEE Certifications / Professional Certifications

In addition to (or sometimes instead of) PE licensure, many energy engineers pursue professional certifications that demonstrate specialized expertise in energy management and efficiency. The Association of Energy Engineers offers several widely-recognized certifications.
## Key Differences: PE License vs. AEE Certifications

- **PE License** - A legal requirement for certain types of engineering work; governed by state law; requires engineering degree and years of experience; allows you to legally use the title "engineer" and stamp engineering documents
- **AEE Certifications** - Professional credentials that demonstrate specialized knowledge; not legally required but often preferred or required by employers; recognize expertise in energy-specific topics not covered in traditional PE exams; do not substitute for PE licensure when it's legally required

Many successful energy engineers hold both PE licensure and one or more AEE certifications, combining the legal authority to practice engineering with demonstrated expertise in energy-specific applications.
